    "# HuggingFace Pretrained Wav2Vec2-Conformer with Rotary Position Embeddings Inference on Inf2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to compile and run a HuggingFace 🤗 Wav2Vec2-Conformer model with rotary position embeddings for accelerated inference on Neuron. This notebook will use the facebook/wav2vec2-conformer-rope-large-960h-ft model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook should be run on an Inf2 or Trn1 instance, of size Inf2.8xlarge or Trn1.2xlarge or larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for deployment, it is recommended to pre-compile the model on a compute instance using torch_neuronx.trace(), save the compiled model as a .pt file, and then distribute the .pt to Inf2.8xlarge instances for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify that this Jupyter notebook is running the Python kernel environment that was set up according to the PyTorch Installation Guide. You can select the kernel from the 'Kernel -> Change Kernel' option on the top of this Jupyter notebook page."
