    "To get a large language model working on Inf2 & Trn1, tensor parallelism is used to split weights and data across multiple NeuronCores. Each NeuronCore has 16GB of memory. As a rule of thumb, the total space required per NeuronCore will be at least `2 * number of model parameters` for a `float16` casted model. In reality, the total space required is often greater due to the key value cache, which grows with sequence lenght. This memory usage determines the minimum viable instance size since the amount of memory that will be allocated on one NeuronCore is directly proportional to the parallelism degree (`tp_degree`), or rather the number of physical NeuronCores per instance. The parallelism degree must be chosen to ensure that the memory usage per NeuronCore will be less than the physical 16GB limit. While this determines the minimum instance sizing, further decreasing the memory usage per NeuronCore by using a larger instance and a higher `tp_degree` should result in a faster model\n",
