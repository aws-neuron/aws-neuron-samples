    "When using `float16` casted weights for a 13 billion parameter model, this works out to `2 * 13B` or ~26GB of weights. Each NeuronCore has 16GB of memory which means that a 26GB model cannot fit on a single NeuronCore. In reality, the total space required is often greater than just the number of parameters due to caching attention layer projections (KV caching). This caching mechanism grows memory allocations linearly with sequence length and batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get very large language models to fit on Inf2 & Trn1, tensor parallelism is used to split weights, data, and compute across multiple NeuronCores. The number of NeuronCores that the weights are split across can be controlled by setting the `tp_degree` parameter. This parallelism degree must be chosen to ensure that the memory usage per NeuronCore will be less than the physical 16GB limit. When configuring tensor parallelism, the memory per NeuronCore can be computed with:\n",

    "```\n",
    "memory per core = (bytes per parameter * number of parameters) / tp_degree\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that increasing the `tp_degree` beyond the minimum requirement almost always results in a faster model. Increasing the tensor parallelism degree improves memory bandwidth which improves model performance. To optimize performance it's recommended to use the highest tensor parallelism degree that is supported by the instance. In this sample we use tensor parallelism degree 32 to optimize performance on `trn1.32xlarge`, but this should be changed to 24 if you are using a `inf2.48xlarge`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Neuron `LlamaForSampling` class to implement tensor parallelism for the CodeLlama model. We supply the n_positions as 16384 and context length estimates to precompile various possible prompt lengths. Tensor parallelism is enabled through the argument `tp_degree=32`. We enable `float16` casting with the `amp='f16'` flag. The model computational graph is compiled by `neuronx-cc` for optimized inference on Neuron."
