# PyTorch Neuron (transformers-neuronx) Samples for AWS Inf2 & Trn1

This directory contains sample Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating tensor parallel inference for various PyTorch large language models (LLMs) on [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/) (Inf2) instances) and [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) (Trn1) instances.

For additional information on these training scripts, please refer to the tutorials found in the <mark>official Inferentia and Trainium documentation</mark>.

## Inference

The following samples are available for LLM tensor parallel inference:

| Name                                                        | Instance type |
