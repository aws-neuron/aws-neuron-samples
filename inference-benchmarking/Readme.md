# Inference benchmarking

This folder contains scripts to evaluate accuracy of LLMs with open source datasets. Please refer [Accuracy Eval Developer Guide](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/developer_guides/accuracy-eval-with-datasets.html) or [Accuracy Evaluation Tutorial](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/tutorials/trn1-llama3.1-70b-instruct-accuracy-eval.html) on how to use these scripts. 

## Update
We have added script that helps in determining the performance of LLMs in Neuron. Please refer [Performance Developer Guide](https://awsdocs-neuron-staging.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/developer_guides/performance-cli-params.html) or [Performance Tutorial](https://awsdocs-neuron-staging.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/tutorials/Generating_Results_with_Performance_Cli.html) on how to run the scripts
